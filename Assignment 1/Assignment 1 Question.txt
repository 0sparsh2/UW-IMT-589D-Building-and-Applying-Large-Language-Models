1. From the assigned reading this week, answer the following questions (no more than one page):
    I. Take a query as an example and show how maximum likelihood approach works with a document as a language model. [2 points]
    II. Why would you want to expand a document model with a corpus model? How would you do that? [3 points]

2. In the class we saw how to construct bigram model for text prediction. Do the same with a trigram model. Here, you will take two characters to predict the next character. Provide your qualitative assessment of any differences you see between bigram-based generation and trigram-based generation. Include appropriate parts of your code segments to show the key elements of constructing the trigram model. [5 points]

Submit a single PDF file with no more than 2 pages in length. Any other format or late submission will not be graded.
